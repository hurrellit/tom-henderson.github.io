Not sure why this isn't built in to OS X. [Colour Picker](https://github.com/tom-henderson/colour-picker) is a nice easy way to launch the system colour picker from spotlight or the dock. It's literally a 2 word applescript application:

	choose color

I'd recommend using the icon from /Applications/Utilities/DigitalColor Meter.app.
